# Daniel Arbach

## Introduction

I am a U.S. veteran attending the Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp for Java + Android. Upon
graduating and passing my Oracle Java industry certification test, I plan to earn
employment in the greater ABQ area.

## Experience

* Currently building a Java Spring-Boot Android full-stack webservice app to share astronomy images and locate stars using the phone’s camera and positional sensors.

* Designed entity-relationship diagrams wireframe diagrams for both projects with draw.io.
* Customized build files in Gradle and Maven to manage library and module dependencies.
* Designing annotated entity Java objects for use with Hibernate Room and JPA Object Relational Mappers.
