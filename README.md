## Introduction

I am a U.S. veteran attending the Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp for Java + Android. Upon
graduating and passing my Oracle Java industry certification test, I plan to earn
employment in the greater ABQ area.

## Experience

### Student @ Deep Dive 
* Currently building a Java Spring-Boot Android full-stack webservice app to share astronomy images and locate stars using the phone’s camera and positional sensors.
* Built a Java Android calculator app to parse and evaluate a dice rolling grammar using the Shunting-Yard algorithm, and store the roll results in the phone’s SQLite database.
* Designed entity-relationship database and user interface wireframe diagrams for both projects with draw.io.
* Customized build files in Gradle and Maven to manage library and module dependencies.
* Designing annotated entity Java objects for use with Hibernate Room and JPA Object Relational Mappers.
* Created Spring-Boot GET and POST endpoints for REST-ful service endpoints using Spring-Boot annotations.

### Computer Programmer @ Air Force Safety Center
* Performed daily programming maintenance on a Java/Javascript web-based reporting tool and Oracle database backend.
* Worked on an Agile Scrum development team in which members had to be self-motivated and use critical thinking skills to trouble-shoot software bugs and develop new functionality.
* Designed and developed a database model for tracking motorcycle rider data among military members. This was the first Air Force-wide system that consolidated information concerning rider safety training across all Air Force bases world-wide.
